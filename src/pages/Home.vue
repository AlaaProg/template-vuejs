                            I live in Iraq. I graduated from college at the end of 2015 from the Department of English Literature, and not Computer Science (if you were thinking that). I was not allowed to get a degree in Computer Science in Iraq. The law here does not allow blind people to obtain a degree in Computer Science or any scientific stream such as Mathematics or Physics.

                            I like to tell jokes, I like it when people laugh until they canâ€™t breathe, it makes me happy
